## Challenging

### My Git Culinary Collection
- Concepts: 
  - git init
  - git branch
  - Basic git commands ( add, commit, status )
  - git checkout to switch branch
  - git merge
Put World Culinary Collection into Git. Initialize a local repo, create the primary folder and summary.txt, then commit. For each country, create a new branch, then add the culinary together with the subfolder. Remember to update the summary file in primary folder. Then switch branch to master/main and do a merge.
- Input: 
  - Data from World Culinary Collection or create new ones
- Output:
  - A local git repo containing branches of country and culinary data.
- Directions:
  - Create primary folder
  - Init a local repo inside primary folder
  - Create summary file
  - git add and commit
  - Git branch for each country
  - Create folder for each country
  - Add the culinary file and image to each country
  - Update summary file in primary folder
  - git checkout to main branch
  - git merge country branch to main
- Rule:
  - Same rule as World Culinary Collection
  - Each country have it's own branch, the order for directions does not matter (create folder then branch is OK, create branch then create folder is OK).
  - If possible repeat this 5 times, each student sharing their screen and add new culinary ( googling, add, commit, merge) with other mentee supporting and mentor facilitating if mistakes are made.
