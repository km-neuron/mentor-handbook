# Railway - Simple CRUD Tasks List

This folder shows examples of a simple CRUD Tasks for deployment to Railway.

While the primary material is deployment to Railway, the simple CRUD Tasks List is good to be built together with students, so they understand how to handle database operations in Go. Note that database here is an in-memory manager, not actually SQL based database.

This server starts on port 8080 and listens for requests at the /tasks endpoint. You can then use the form from there. You can test it by navigating to http://localhost:8080/tasks in your web browser after starting the server. Naturally when hosted on Railway, the localhost:8080 need to be changed.

Feel free to add more functionalities to the simple CRUD Tasks. Perhaps some styling is in order.
