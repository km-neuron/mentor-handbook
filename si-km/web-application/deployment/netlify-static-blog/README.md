# Netlify Simple Static Blog Site

This folder shows examples of some static website for deployment to Netlify.

While the primary material is deployment to Netlify, the static website is built with HTML and CSS, so if possible, build the HTML and CSS together with students and deploy the static website.

Remember that this is a static site, so we need to create new post.html for every post.

## index.html

This will list all the blog posts and provide a link to the individual post. Feel free to add new post, remember to create a new unique post.html for the content.

## post.html

This will contain the individual post content. Feel free to create new post.html using this as a template.

## styles.css

This will hold all the styles used for the blog. Feel free to add and/or edit the CSS styles.
