## Basic

### Simple Book Collection

- Concepts:
  - React Router DOM.
    - Able to create multipage website.
- Input:
  - A list of books with ISBN in JSON format, available at "src/data/books.json"
- Output:
  - A website showing the books in a list and link for book details that will show in another page. And a search page to filter books by name.
- Directions:
  - Example is available at folder "/books-collection"
  - Use CRA to create React app.

  - Import Routes and Route ke App.js
  - Create three routes:
    - endpoint "/" as "Home"
    - endpoint "book" as "Book List"
    - endpoint "book/:isbn" as "Book Detail" as child of "book"
  - Create folder "/routes" in "/src"
  - Create Components for each route
    - "Home" contains "Hello, welcome to my Book Collection"
      - Add Link that will redirect to endpoint "book"
    - "Book List" contains List of Books
      - Setup the input booksData here, by import from JSON file.
      - Create Component to render the data in folder "/cards"
        - Book name
        - Link to book detail using ISBN as param.
    - "Book Detail" contain Information about the book. 
      - Grab the isbn from useParams(), pass it to BookDetail Component that we'll create
      - Create Component to render the data in folder "/cards"
        - This is not ideal, but we also setup the input booksData here, by import from JSON file.
        - We'll search by isbn the actual book.
        - Then we'll show
          - Book name
          - Book description
  - Play around some more creating or modifying new route
  - If you want, you can create a wrapper to simulate API call.
  - You can also use fetch() and actually use 3rd party API.
  - There is no styling, feel free to style it before hand.
