## Learning Objectives

- Understand how Concurrency works

## Pre-requisites

- Code editor (e.g. VS Code).
- Golang installed in local computer

## Basic

### Social Media Status Checker

- Concepts:
  - Concurrency
- Input:
  - A list of website in an array of string: e.g. <https://facebook.com>, <https://twitter.com>, <https://linkedin.com>
- Output:
  - A string showing HTTP Status Codes and website is up or down (one line for each website), e.g. "[200] <https://facebook.com> is up"
- Direction:
  - Create a function to output the website status.
  - Use simple http.Get() and format the output.
  - Show how the output is in order without using concurrency, if possible show the time taken to complete.
  - Update to use concurrency using go routine.
  - Show how the output is kind of random, if possible show the time taken to complete.
  - Update to use concurrency using channel
