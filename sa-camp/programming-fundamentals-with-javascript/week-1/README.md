# Programming Fundamentals with Javascript Mentoring Week-1

## Basic Rules

- **This is not a demo!**
- Mentor will be the facilitator, guiding the mentee to solve the tasks.
- One person will share their screen, can be the mentor and one of the mentee.
- Mentee will take turn in giving the correct commands to be typed by person sharing his/her screen.
- For clarity, please watch [video SWE Mentoring Briefing Week-1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1X7qFUQR0KNECR3rDoPtTyzjWpG27MzKf/view?usp=sharing).

## Learning Objectives

- Understand daily activities as a software engineer.
  - Able to formulate algorithm to solve a problem.
  - Able to create pseudocode for simple application.
  - Able to connect with Github and work with Github repo
    - git clone
    - git checkout
    - git push

## Pre-requisites

- Install code editor (e.g. VS Code)
- Install gitBash for Windows or git for Linux based distro (in WSL for windows)
- Create account in github

## Basic

### Online Food Order

- Concepts:
  - Algorithm
  - Pseudocode
- Input:
  - Idea about how online food order works.
- Output:
  - Either one flowchart ( preferred ) or one text file containg Algorithm
  - One text file containing Pseudocode
- Directions:
  - Brainstorm how online food order works
  - Open online flowchart tool or create empty file
  - Create the flowchart or write the steps in the algorithm
  - After algorithm stage is finished,
  - Create empty file
  - Write the pseudocode
- Rule:
  - Keep it simple
  - Only cover choosing from the menu and payment.

### Github Link

- Concepts:
  - Github repo
  - Git remote
  - Git push
  - Git commit
- Input: Local git project
- Output: Github repo linked with local git project
- Directions:
  - Preferably use the local git repo ( World Culinary Collection) from last week. Can also create a new one ( if time permits ) with similar structure of folder and files.
  - Create one github repo.
  - Use git remote to link local git repo with github repo
  - Use git push after commit and check the changes in github.
- Rule:
  - Use git remote to link

## Challenging

### Vacation Planning with Github

- Concepts:
  - Github Repo
  - git clone
  - git branch
  - Basic git commands ( add, commit, status )
  - git push
  - Pull Request
- Input:
  - Ideas about vacation planning from search for destination, booking and travel schedule ( actual travelling, e.g. First day by plane to Bangkok, Second day travel to Market, third day free time or visit local shrine, fourth day return to Jakarta.) Some travel such as cruises offer branching of either stay in the ship or debark to see the nearest town from the port.
  - Github repo from mentor or ask one mentee to create one github repo
- Output:
  - Algorithm using flowchart in one image file
  - Pseudocode in one text file
  - Both are stored in Github
- Directions:
  - Prepare a Github repo, can be by mentor or mentee
  - Ask mentee to git clone the repo
  - Make this a individual collective effort, meaning, give the mentee time, 15 minutes perhaps to create the algorithm and pseudocode, commit and push to individual branch by their names. No PR request yet.
  - Then mentor will show one time how to create a PR
  - Mentee will then create PR based off their branch.
  - Mentor will then do a review for each PR request, pointing out improvement areas for individual mentee, the other mentee can watch as they can learn also.
  - It is possible to have merge conflict, try to resolve together.
  - Can use tools for flowchart such as app.diagrams.net, lucidchart, etc. Export as jpg / png.
- Rule:
  - Individual collective effort
