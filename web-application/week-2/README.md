### Quote App Server

- Concepts:
  - REST API
  - HTTP Client
  - Handling JSON format
  - HTTP Server
  - Database management
- Input:
  - Use Quote App with Database from Week-1
  - OR Find any free quote API and store some quotes to the database or choose from these two:

    - https://zenquotes.io/
- Output:
  - API endpoints, at least 2
    - 1 endpoint for random quote
    - 1 endpoint for quote of the day
- Directions:
  - Store the data into Postgres if not already.
  - Create HTPP server with 2 endpoints
    - 1 for /random/ (endpoint can be changed)
    - 1 for /quote_of_the_day/  (endpoint can be changed)
  - Random endpoint should return random quote from database everytime the page is called.
  - Quote of the day should only change every 24 hours, so each call if still within same day, should not change the quote.
  - Style the quote as desired.
